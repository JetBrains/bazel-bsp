# Bazel BSP

An implementation of the [Build Server Protocol](https://github.com/build-server-protocol/build-server-protocol) for
Bazel.

## Status

Below is a list of languages supported over Bazel BSP and their implementation status.

- Language: name of the Language
- Import: Ability to import a project's targets, sources, dependencies, and resources.
- Compilation: Ability to compile
- Run: Ability to run
- Test: Ability to test
- Prerequisites: Any prerequisites needed to properly run the server to its full capabilities

| Language | Import | Compilation | Run | Test | Diagnostics | Prerequisites | Notes | 
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Scala | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | [Toolchain Registration](docs/usage/scala.md) | N/A | 
| Java | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 
| Kotlin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Requires [this version](https://github.com/agluszak/rules_kotlin/tree/diagnostics-updated) of rules_kotlin | KotlinJS support is minimal and not advised without further setting changes. Java source files in a kotlin rule will not possess diagnostics. |

## Installation

### Easy way (coursier)

1. Have [coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) installed
2. Run in the directory where Bazel BSP should be installed:

```
cs launch org.jetbrains.bsp:bazel-bsp:1.1.1 -M org.jetbrains.bsp.bazel.install.Install
```

3. Add bsp generated folders to your `.gitignore`: `.bsp` and `.bazelbsp`

### More difficult way (from sources)

Might be useful during development

#### Using install script

1. Be inside this project
2. Run `./install.sh` if you want to install Bazel BSP in this project or `./install.sh <path to the directory>` if you
   want to install it in a different directory

#### Using coursier

1. Have [coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) installed
2. Be inside this project
3. **Change** the project version - `maven_coordinates` attribute in
   the `server/src/main/java/org/jetbrains/bsp/bazel/BUILD` file
4. Publish a new version:

```
bazel run --stamp --define "maven_repo=file://$HOME/.m2/repository" //server/src/main/java/org/jetbrains/bsp/bazel:bsp.publish
```

7. Enter directory where Bazel BSP should be installed
8. Install your version:

```
cs launch -r m2Local org.jetbrains.bsp:bazel-bsp:<your version> -M org.jetbrains.bsp.bazel.install.Install
```

## Project Views

In order to work on huge monorepos you might want to specify directories and targets to work on. To address this issue,
Bazel BSP supports (partly) the [Project Views](https://ij.bazel.build/docs/project-views.html) introduced by Google.

Check [project view readme](projectview/README.md) for more info.

## Tests

### End-to-end tests

`e2e` directory contains end-2-end tests that check various scenarios of server usage.

- `bazel run //e2e:all` - to run all tests
- `bazel run //e2e:<specific test>` - to run a specific test (to see all possible tests, check the `e2e/BUILD` file)

### Unit tests

Most modules also have unit tests that can be run using `bazel test //<module>/...` or just `bazel test //...` to run
all tests in the project.

## Extending

In order to extend BSP server to other languages, make sure it can be supported with the current state of
the  [BSP Protocol](https://github.com/build-server-protocol/build-server-protocol/tree/master/docs). Also, make sure
there's a [client](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/docs/implementations.html#build-clients), that will be able
to support those changes.

For any JVM-language, the only needed changes would be for its specific Compiler Options Request (see, for example
the [Scala Options Request](https://github.com/build-server-protocol/build-server-protocol/blob/master/docs/extensions/scala.md#scalac-options-request))
. If that language does not have its own Options Request, it may be possible to mimic the behavior with current Java or
Scala specific requests. Furthermore, make sure the `FILE_EXTENSIONS` constant holds all the relevant extensions for the
given language, as well as the `KNOWN_SOURCE_ROOTS` holds all known patterns for the given language, and, finally,
the `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` should hold the LSP compliant name of the language. Anything else, should just work out of the
box.

Any non-JVM language, will also need to look into the `buildTarget/dependencySources` request, since that request only
searches for transitive dependencies in the form of jars.

To support Compilation Diagnostics for the given language, they must be supported in the bazel side. Find the rules'
implementation for the language [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/). Let
the [diagnostics proto definition](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_scala/blob/master/src/protobuf/io/bazel/rules_scala/diagnostics.proto)
live inside its repository and make it so that the compiler writes the diagnostics to the given file. **Make sure the
file is an output of the `ctx.actions.run()` for the compilation action**. The current state also dictates that the file
must have the keyword `diagnostics` in the name. In `BepServer.java`, the mnemonic of the compilation action of the
language must be added to the `SUPPORTED_ACTIONS` constant.

Compilation Diagnostics should receive native support from bazel, accompany the state of
that [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/11766).
