## [Unreleased]

### Features üéâ

- Improved bazel runner. The BSP Client now receives invoked bazel command,
  its output, duration and exit code.
  | [#198](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/198)
- Scala diagnostics work without a fork (technically it worked already for a while).
  | [#170](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/170)

### Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

- Fixed extraction of java version and java home for bazel `5.0.0`.
  | [#165](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/165)
- Log messages are no longer trimmed.
  | [#157](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/157)
- Memoize BazelProcess output so that it doesn't get lost.
  | [#154](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/154)

### Changes üîÑ

- Project uses bazel `5.1.0`.
  | [#208](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/208)
- JUnit5!
  | [#206](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/206)
- Support for excluded targets in the sync mechanism.
  | [#196](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/196)
- Introduction of installation context.
  | [#184](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/184)
- Project uses (mostly) `io.vavr.Option` and `io.vavr.List`.
  | [#192](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/192)
- Introducing execution context and workspace context.
  | [#172](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/172)
- Changed the structure of the [README](README.md) and other documents and added contribution guide.
  | [#181](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/181)
- Project view parser has more logging, targets section is optional and 
  sections are using specific types instead of raw strings.
  | [#166](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/166)
- Improve the `install.sh` script. 
  | [#167](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/167)
- Now the project is using the latest bazel version - `5.0.0`.
  Installer skips bazelisk cache binaries during bazel binary discovery mechanism.
  | [#160](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/160)
- Rewrite of all endpoints to rely on single bazel aspect to extract all necessary data.
  It improves performance and correctness as wel as extensibility of the server.
  With this change also c++ support is temporarily dropped.

  | [#130](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/130)
- `JvmBuildServer` implementation - now tests execution should be working!
  | [#128](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/128)
- Improved heuristics for guessing source roots. It looks directory structures such as `src/java` or `main/java`.
  | [#126](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/126)

### Changes üîÑ

- Server filters out non-runtime jars for running apps and tests.
  | [#131](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/131)

- Server builds a project during sync in order to fix dependency resolving mechanism.
  | [#137](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/137)
- Server handles aspects properly when multiple projects are in workspace.
  | [#132](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp/pull/132)
- Now the project is built using bazel version `3.7.2`, as the rules currently used are no longer supported by bazel.
