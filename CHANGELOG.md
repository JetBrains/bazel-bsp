## [3.0.0] - 09.08.2023

### BREAKING CHANGES üö®

- The server no longer builds the project on initial sync -
  in order to generate and collect generated sources build + resync is required.

  longer* fields in project view files! They can be set *only* using installer flags (check [README](install/README.md)).
